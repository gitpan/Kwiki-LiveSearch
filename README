NAME
    Kwiki::LiveSearch - Search and Display pagelink on the fly!

DESCRIPTION
    Kwiki::LiveSearch is a Kwiki plugin that allow anyone search the kwiki
    site in a fancy way. Results are displayed right after you enter the
    text.

    To use this plugin, simply install Kwiki and this module from CPAN, and
    do:

        # echo 'Kwiki::LiveSearch' >> plugins
        # kwiki -update

    Currently the code of searching text is the same from Kwiki::Search, and
    it's not very efficient, your server will have heavy load when there are
    many people using this search plugin. In the future the indexing
    algorithm should be improved to reduce the time and load.

    The code of livesearch.js come from http://blog.bitflux.ch/. It's
    modified a little to fit cgi scriptname.
